  In this article I use Emscripten to render an STL model in the browser with 
  the help of Magnum library. I'll use Conan and packages from ConanCenter to
  get the libraries and build everything needed. Finally we will get the files
  we need to deploy in a web server to interact with the 3D model. In this 
  blogpost I'm not entering into the logic or sources, the purpose is to show
  a working project that can be used in future developments.

Some months ago I joined a 3D course using Blender. The main purpose was to
recover this hobby I enjoyed a lot in the good old days, but soon my mind started
to think about showing those 3D models in the browser. Using C++, of course.
Spoiler: I didn't finish the course.

Anyway, before moving forwards, I want to show you the viking shield I managed
to do in the first lessons. I really enjoyed it and I can only recommend all the
courses that 
<content-twitter-user user="par_virtual">Pablo</content-twitter-user> 
and <content-twitter-user user="KoreFormacion">Kor√© team</content-twitter-user>
will organize in the future.

## Looking for alternatives 

When it comes to web and C++ there are not too many options
out there. So far I can only think about
<nuxt-link to="/blog/2021-01-19-emscripten-cube">Qt</nuxt-link> and
[Wt](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt), any other alternative would involve dealing
with HTML and CSS. In this case I didn't want a fully featured application, I
just wanted to render some 3D.

For this example I was going to need some graphics library able to import the
3D data and the corresponding graphic engine to render it. There are many
libraries that satisfies these two requirements (it remembers me two years ago
when for some reason lot of people from the C++ community started to build their own 
[raytracing implementation](https://manu343726.github.io/2019-06-20-raytracer-runtime-postmortem/)),
but when you start to search for 3D and web, and you add Emscripten to the equation
the alternatives are narrowed. In fact, I only found [Magnum](https://magnum.graphics/)
satisfying all these requirements.


### Magnum libraries

Magnum looked like a good approach: modern library, active development, modular architecture,
plugins,... with a lot of examples showcasing different examples built using Emscripten.

  caption="Magnum architecture is organize into layers that add functionality on top of each other. The foundation are the core libraries that provides some platform abstraction and very basic features. On top of these layers, some extra modules contribute with actual functionaliy for different use-cases. This architecture makes it easy to contribute new modules and extensions.">

For this example I just needed to build the core libraries with some OpenGL (WebGL)
support, and the required components to import my 3D models. Anyway, those were
a bunch of libraries using different build systems.


## Building the libraries

**Magnum project** is quite good at documentation, and a lot of attention has been paid to
the build system. Magnum provides good and modern `CMakeLists.txt` files and every single
option is [exhaustively documented](https://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/building.html#building-manual).

The core library `Magnum` depends only on a bunch of third party libraries, and some of them are
optional depending on the active features. Many other libraries are required if we start to add
plugins related to other features: mesh importers, fonts, images, sound,...

There are plenty of plugins in the 
<content-github-repository repo="mosra/magnum-plugins">magnum-plugins</content-github-repository>
repository. I won't need all of them, but the following graph shows the third party libraries
that are required if we want to activate them. Of course, for this little example we don't need
all of them, they are just listed here for completeness.

If you have some experience with C++ ecosystem, soon you will think that these are too many
libraries and it will be very challenging to build all of them from sources. Thankfully, some
of them can be installed at system level using the system package manager or similar tools.
Nevertheless this would introduce some limitations and compatibility issues, but this is not
the place to talk about it.

Given all these libraries I decided to approach the problem using a package manager. Of course,
the choosen one was [Conan](https://conan.io) (I work in the project). Thanks to the community
effort most of the libraries were already available in [ConanCenter](https://conan.io/center),
but still there were some missing libraries.

### Conanize all the things 

It took some time to create all the missing recipes and improve existing ones to be able to
_conanize_ all the libraries in the Magnum graph, but hopefully this effort is worth it and
other people from the community will benefit from it.

In [this issue](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/pull/6292) you can find most of
the changes that were required to add `magnum/2020.06` to ConanCenter. As you can see it took me
around three months to contribute all the changes and there are still some missing improvements,
mostly related to Emscripten, but it's not clear to me how to address them in the context
of <content-github-repository repo="conan-io/conan-center-index">conan-center-index</content-github-repository>
repository.

Of course, it hasn't been only my work, but the effort of several contributors from the community that
helped me creating other recipes. Thanks and kudos to all of them. Now you can just install all required
libraries with Conan and use it in your project:

```bash
conan install magnum/2020.06@
```

## Emscripten

[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) is a toolchain based on LLVM to generate WebAssembly binaries.
These binaries can run in the browser. In my honest opinion is one of the most interesting technologies
today: compact output, near-native speed and same source code as desktop. 

From a C++ developer point of view, it's just a cross-building toolchain that generates some `.wasm` and
`.js` files that can be loaded and executed by the browser. Due to security reason, access to system
resources is limited and that's the reason by some libraries don't build out of the box and need some
modifications (see <content-github-user user="emscripten-ports"></content-github-user>). There are
two main limitation we will face in this example: OpenGL is substituted by WebGL (it supports only
a subset of OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0), and access to filesystem is forbidden (although it can be virtualized). 

Thanks to <content-github-user user="werto87"></content-github-user> there is a recipe for `emsdk`
available in ConanCenter, so crossbuilding our libraries to WebAssembly will be straightforward
using this package as a Conan's build-requirement. Below I will list the commands you need to execute.

### Magnum and SDL

However, when it comes to SDL requirement in Magnum there is a problem with several root causes. Magnum, when
building for desktop, depends on SDL v2, but when building for web it uses SDL v1. Why? SDL v1 is
basically deprecated, and that's probably the reason why Magnum started to use the new version, but
Emscripten still provides vendorized SDL v1 so it is probably easier to keep using old functions.

From Conan perspective this is quite unfortunate. We only have
[SDL v2 available in ConanCenter](https://conan.io/center/sdl) so we cannot switch the requirement
when building for the web and we need to use the vendorized SDL version in `emsdk`. It works so far, 
but we loose track of this dependencie and possible transitive requirements. 

I don't have enough SDL expertise to contribute a PR to Magnum and move the requirement to v2 and,
on the other hand, I didn't manage to _conanize_ SDL v1 (and it's probably not worth it since it is
mainly deprecated).

Here we are likely in a dead-end if we want to do the things right, I would love to update this blogpost
in the near future saying that everything has been fixed and ready. Meanwhile we need to accept the
workarounds mentioned above and keep going.

## Show me the code! (reproducible steps)

Time for fun! In this first attemp I'm just copying the `viewer` example from the
<content-github-repository repo="mosra/magnum-examples" link_internal="tree/master/src/viewer">magnum-examples repository</content-github-repository>
and modify it a little bit to load the STL model. In this blogpost I'm not
explaining the logic or entering the source code, the intention here is to show that it works
and provide a starting point for some actual development.

All required sources can be found in my
<content-github-repository repo="jgsogo/blog-emsdk-magnum-viewer">GitHub account</content-github-repository>,
so the first step is to clone the repository to your local computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgsogo/blog-emsdk-magnum-viewer
cd blog-emsdk-magnum-viewer
```

In this project I will use [Conan revisions](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/versioning/revisions.html)
and [lockfiles](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/versioning/lockfiles.html#versioning-lockfiles), the purpose
is to achieve reproducibility and guarantee that it will work in the future. Using these two features
together we can force the recipe revisions that we know that work.

Let's configure Conan in a local folder, so we don't disturb global installation:

```bash
export CONAN_USER_HOME=$(pwd)
conan config set general.revisions_enabled=1
```

Now we are going to export two recipes with some modifications that are needed to work with Emscripten. These
changes haven't been contributed to the
<content-github-repository repo="conan-io/conan-center-index">conan-center-index</content-github-repository>
repository yet, we probably need to think and decide first about [this issue](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/7427).

```bash
conan export .conan/recipes/magnum/all/conanfile.py magnum/2020.06@
conan export .conan/recipes/libjpeg/all/conanfile.py libjpeg/9d@
```

Now create a move to the build directory:

```bash
mkdir cmake-build-emsdk && cd cmake-build-emsdk
```

And it's time to use the lockfiles. A Conan lockfile is a file that states the exact revision of the packages
involved in a dependency graph. Conan can use one of these files to download the packages from the remote and
reproduce exactly the same scenario in another computer. However, as we said before, the dependencies are not
exactly the same when building for desktop or emscripten (sometimes they are different for different configurations),
so a true lockfile won't fit our needs. Fortunately, Conan provides _base lockfiles_ that capture only the
recipe revision and this is what I'm using here and it is stored in the `lockfile.json` file.

Using this _base lockfile_, we can create the full lockfile that matches our configuration. Different configs
will use different packages (different binaries), but still they will use the same recipe revision.

```bash
conan lock create --profile:host=../.conan/profiles/emsdk --profile:build=default --lockfile=../lockfile.json --lockfile-out=lockfile.json --name=viewer --version=0.1 ../conanfile.txt --build --update
```

Now, we can use the generated file to install all the requirements in our dependency graph:

```bash
conan install --lockfile=lockfile.json ../conanfile.txt --build=missing --generator=virtualenv
```

Conan has generated everything we need to build the project: the module files that will be
consumed by CMake (the well-known `FindXXX.cmake` files for the libraries) and some bash scripts
to populate the environment with the information that the build-system needs to use the
Emscripten toolchain.

Next step is to activate the environment and build the project as usual:

```bash
source activate.sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=$(pwd) -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$CONAN_CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE
make
```

The build should succeed, at least it does in the CI (see badge at the top). In order
to see it working in your computer, you just need to start a web server and point
your browser to the HTML file:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory bin
http://localhost:8000/viewer.html
```

## Enjoy!

Here you have it: the Conan cube rendered using WebAssembly, use the moouse to navigate and move the object:
